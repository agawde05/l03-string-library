So Apple actually wants to trademark the iPhone 11's 'slofie'

Apple must really think slow-motion selfies are going to catch on. 

After announcing the upcoming iPhone feature, the tech giant submitted an application to trademark the word "slofie," 
which could limit how other smartphone makers market similar camera capabilities. 

Slofies are images created using Apple's slow-motion setting that will be available on the new phones' front-facing selfie cam. 
The video software shoots 120 frames per second, and when those frames are slowed down, the resulting image has a slo-mo effect. 

Details are sparse in the trademark application, which was submitted Sept. 13. Apple does define slofie as "downloadable computer 
software for use in capturing and recording video." 

Apple paid $400 to submit the application. 

The tech giant presented an ad for slofies this month when it unveiled the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. People 
on the internet wondered whether it was spelled "slowfie" or "slofie."  Apple's patent filing seems to have laid that debate to rest.

Slofies were met with mixed reactions on social media after Apple announced the latest software.

Some people said they couldn't wait to use the new tool, and others found DIY ways to create slofies using Apple's older smartphones. 
Twitter user @aamiralltaf71 called slofies "not so impressive."
